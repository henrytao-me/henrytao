Last week, I joined [#fossasia](https://twitter.com/fossasia). This was amazing event and organized in amazing country - Singapore. 

### 1. People is so nice

It's quite crowded in Singapore especially under MRT. However I didn't think it's a problem here. People here walk so fast and orderly which I rarely see it in my country. My legs were really painful in the first 3 days. Next time, if you plan to come to Singapore, make sure your "walking skill" is good enough to catch up with their speed.

### 2. Government mindset

It's nice to have [Prof. Vivian](https://twitter.com/VivianBala) - Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Singapore to come on stage and give a talk about open source at [#fossasia](https://twitter.com/fossasia). He definitely got attention of everyone in the room (including me) by showing his code on [#nodejs](https://nodejs.org) and how he can connect, retrieve and extract information from Singapore public data. Someone asked him "How did Singapore build up a wealthy country? What's Singapore advantages? What're lessons learn from other countries?". Here are some of his answers which made me admire a lot. 

- Singapore is a small country and managing a small country is more easier than big country. 
- Almost people in government in Singapore either has Math degree or Computer Science degree. Most of them are running a business in real life which is another big advantage comparing to other country.

### 3. Transportation is so good

The only thing I can say about MRT is awesome. Taking the control of transportation instead of giving it to single citizen (Ex: motobike) is a good idea. In my opinion, the benefit of that are less air pollution, less traffic, less accident, less annoy (from people driving too fast or too slow).

### 4. No trash

I don't see any trash in Singapore. Well, it's a fancy word. Actually, there is some trash but not enough for me to count it :D. It's better than my country a lot and a lot.

### 5. No police

I don't see any policies in Singapore but camera. My friend and I argue about where is the military in Singapore. I bet they are training under the ground. Haha.


### 6. English everywhere 

Notable here. They can talk English quite well. I think my English can improve a lot if I have a chance to come and work here next time. 


### 7. Air conditioner almost everywhere

This season is not so hot in Singapore. However, even in hot season, I think it's quite OK because air conditioner is almost everywhere. 


### 8. Nice View

If you have photo sphere, check it out. I like Marina Bay Sands and Garden By The Bay. I haven't gone to the top of Marina Bay Sands, inside the Big Tree in Garden By The Bay, Safari and Tiger Tower. See you next time Singapore.

### 9. Big Big Big

My impression about Singapore is everything is big, really big, from skyscraper to big tree, big shell, big scrap and more... It's really amazing. 


### 10. Finally, let's shoot the fly

The funny thing at Changi airport is that when I were in toilet, I were looking for a place to ... shoot. I saw a fly in the first booth, then next booth also has a fly, then next booth... Then I realized that it's intentional there for shooting. LOL. It's quite nice idea. I just only focused on shooting that fly. Haha. Sorry, I didn't take that picture for you. :D 


See you next time, Singapore. I will be there with my love!
